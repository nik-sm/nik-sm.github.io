As important decisions about the distribution of societyâ€™sresources become increasingly automated, it isessential to consider the measurement and enforcement of fairness in these decisions. In this work we build on theresults of Dwork and Ilvento in [1], which laid the foundations for the study of fair algorithms under composition.In particular, we study the cohort selection problem, wherewe wish to use a fair classifier to selectkcandidatesfrom an arbitrarily ordered set of sizen > k, while preserving individual fairness and maximizing utility. We definea linear utility function to measure performance relative to the behavior of the original classifier. We develop afair, utility-optimalO(n)-time cohort selection algorithm for the offline setting, and our primary result, a solutionto the problem in the streaming setting that keeps no more thanO(k) pending candidates at all time.
