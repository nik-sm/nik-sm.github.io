I'm a third year PhD student in Northeastern University's [Probabilistic Modeling Group](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jwvdm/).
I currently work on using generative modeling for machine vision and semi-supervised image classification.
One of my long term research goals is to apply generative modeling to the analysis of raw signal data from neurons.
Keep an eye out for my upcoming work in the NeurIPS 2020 [Workshop on Deep Learning and Inverse Problems](https://deep-inverse.org/) on test-time generator surgery for compressed sensing.
