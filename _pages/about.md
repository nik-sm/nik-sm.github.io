I'm a third year PhD student in Northeastern University's [Probabilistic Modeling Group](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jwvdm/).
I currently work on using generative modeling for machine vision and semi-supervised image classification.
One of my long term research goals is to apply generative modeling to the analysis of raw signal data from neurons.
Check out [my recent work](https://openreview.net/forum?id=s2EucjZ6d2s) in the NeurIPS 2020 [Workshop on Deep Learning and Inverse Problems](https://deep-inverse.org/), where we show that cutting initial layers of a generative signal prior at test time greatly improves image recovery performance for compressed sensing.
