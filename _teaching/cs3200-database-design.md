This is a description of a teaching experience. You can use markdown like any other post.

As head teaching assistant for [CS3200 Database Design](https://northeastern-datalab.github.io/cs3200/fa18s2/), I created and graded homeworks, held office hours and review sessions, helped create exam material, and helped organize my fellow teaching assistants.
