I mentored an undergraduate researcher in an independent project on semi-supervised classification.
I taught him how to train neural networks in PyTorch, and we investigated image classification using [label propagation](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.3864&rep=rep1&type=pdf) in the latent space of a ResNet model.
We examined the effect of different choices of distance metric/kernel function when forming the graph, and also compared the use of a simple affinity matrix against a normalized graph Laplacian matrix.
We compared the performance of these models to a variety of baselines applied to a synthetic latent space constructed by dimensionality reduction on the input data.
